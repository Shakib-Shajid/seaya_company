                    <h3 className='text-xl font-bold'>Types of cookies</h3>
                    <p> Depending on the entity that manages the domain from which the cookies are sent and processes the data obtained, two types can be distinguished:</p> <br />

                    <ul className='list-disc ml-5'>
                        <li><span className='font-bold'>Own cookies: </span> Those that are sent to the user’s terminal equipment from a computer or domain managed by the editor itself and from which the service requested by the user is provided.</li>
                        <li><span className='font-bold'>Third-party cookies:</span> Those that are sent to the user’s terminal equipment from a computer or domain that is not managed by the editor, but by another entity that processes the data obtained through the cookies.</li>
                    </ul> <br />

                    <p>In the event that the cookies are installed from a computer or domain managed by the editor itself but the information collected through them is managed by a third party, they cannot be considered as own cookies.</p> <br />

                    <p>There is also a second classification according to the length of time they remain stored in the client’s browser:</p> <br />

                    <ul className='list-disc ml-5'>
                        <li><span className='font-bold'>Session cookies:</span> Designed to collect and store data while the user accesses a website. They are usually used to store information that only needs to be kept for the provision of the service requested by the user on a single occasion (e.g. a list of products purchased).</li>
                        <li><span className='font-bold'>Persistent cookies:</span> The data remains stored in the terminal and can be accessed and processed for a period defined by the party responsible for the cookie, which can range from a few minutes to several years.</li>
                    </ul> <br />

                    <p>Finally, there is another classification with six types of cookies depending on the purpose for which the data obtained are processed:</p><br />

                    <ul className='list-disc ml-5'>
                        <li><span className='font-bold'>Technical cookies:</span> Those that allow the user to browse through a website, platform or application and use the different options or services that exist on it, such as, for example, controlling traffic and data communication, identifying the session, accessing restricted access areas, remembering the elements that make up an order, carrying out the purchase process of an order, making an application for registration or participation in an event, using security elements during browsing, storing content for the broadcasting of videos or sound or sharing content through social networks.</li>
                        <li><span className='font-bold'>Personalisation cookies:</span> These allow the user to access the service with some predefined general characteristics depending on a series of criteria in the user’s terminal, such as the language, the type of browser used to access the service, the regional configuration from which the service is accessed, etc.</li>
                        <li><span className='font-bold'>Analysis cookies:</span> These allow the party responsible for them to monitor and analyse the behaviour of the users of the websites to which they are linked. The information collected through this type of cookies is used to measure the activity of the websites, application or platform and for the elaboration of browsing profiles of the users of these sites, applications and platforms, in order to introduce improvements based on the analysis of the usage data of the users of the service.</li>
                        <li><span className='font-bold'>Advertising Cookies:</span> These allow the management, in the most efficient way possible, of advertising spaces.</li>
                        <li><span className='font-bold'>Behavioural advertising cookies:</span> These store information on user behaviour obtained through continuous observation of their browsing habits, which allows a specific profile to be developed in order to display advertising based on the same.</li>
                        <li><span className='font-bold'>Cookies from external social networks:</span> These are used so that visitors can interact with the content of different social platforms (facebook, youtube, twitter, linkedIn, etc..) and are generated only for users of these social The conditions of use of these cookies and the information collected is regulated by the privacy policy of the corresponding social platform.</li>
